Testing each an every component / element of the application thoroughly is called as functional testing.

1. Test each and every element of the application for the positive scenario first.
2. If the application is working as expected for the poisitve scenario, continue testing the testing the application for one negative scenario.
3. If the application is responding even to the negative scenario then it means there are bugs in the application so continue testing the application for more negative scenarios.

If the application is tested for positive scenario we call it as positive functional testing and negavite functional testing if it is for negative scenario.
